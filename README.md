# journaling_app

As a way to keep my Python skills sharp, I began developing this journaling application for personal use. I have always had trouble deciding what to build, and when researching ideas, one of the most common answers was to "work on something that you care about". As a part-time writer in my current position, and someone who is looking to develop a habit of journaling, this seemed like the perfect project for me. 

At the moment, the application is a basic tkinter calendar. When selecting a day and pressing the button, a notepad opens up that is attached to that date. At the moment, I am researching further improvements I can make to the functionality and UI/UX of the application.
